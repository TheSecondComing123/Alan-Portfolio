        <p class="work-description">
          At Unbound Labs, I lead frontend development across Unbound Browser and its broader product ecosystem.
          Unbound Browser is designed to be lightweight, privacy-first, and fast, with a clean interface and
          no-tracking approach. Surrounding products include a Scramjet-powered proxy platform with 100+ unblocked
          games, a community chat environment, and a multi-model AI assistant. My role spans UI architecture,
          performance optimization, and shipping production features across these surfaces.

        <h2 class="work-title">Spirr Team</h2>
        <p class="work-description">
          At Spirr Team, I serve as lead frontend developer for Sauna, a browser-based platform for online game ports
          including titles such as Super Mario 64 and FNAF. The product combines a curated game library with a mini-OS
          style interface designed for smooth discovery, launch flow, and session switching. My role covers UI
          architecture, frontend implementation, and interaction polish across the core platform while it continues to
          scale.
