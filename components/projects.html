          <h2 class="carousel-title">Microcosm</h2>
          <p class="carousel-description">2D rogue-like game built with Pygame and OpenGL, where you play as a microbe
            surviving in a hostile petri dish against escalating enemy waves. I implemented procedural encounter
            generation, adaptive enemy AI with behavior states, and enemy scaling tied to player progression, run
            duration, and performance. Combat uses frame-precise hit detection, invulnerability windows, and
            telegraphed attacks, while rendering includes layered particle effects and dynamic lighting passes. I also
            applied high-level math and competitive-programming style optimization to keep updates efficient under
            heavy load, including vectorized movement calculations, aggressive state pruning, and low-overhead
            collision filtering. The result is a fast, replayable loop that stays technically tight and readable even
            in high-intensity fights.</p>

          <h2 class="carousel-title">ACSL Academy</h2>
          <p class="carousel-description">Full-stack ACSL learning platform built with Next.js, Tailwind, and Supabase,
            then deployed on Vercel for fast global access. It contains 30+ structured lessons across core programming
            and computer science topics, plus guided quizzes, account-based progress tracking, dedicated practice
            problem banks, and timed contest-style sets. Students can train by topic, simulate competitive conditions,
            and review performance history over time. I built the content flow around progressive difficulty so users
            move from fundamentals into harder logic and implementation patterns without getting stuck early. The
            platform also supports fast lesson iteration, structured feedback loops, and data-backed refinement of
            practice sets based on where students struggle most. The goal is to make ACSL preparation consistent,
            measurable, and genuinely effective for both self-study and coached workflows.</p>

          <h2 class="carousel-title">The Legend of Rick</h2>
          <p class="carousel-description">2D platformer built with Godot and GDScript, centered on responsive movement,
            readable level design, and progression that increases challenge without spiking frustration. The game
            includes multiple stage archetypes, checkpoint flow, enemy timing systems, and tuned physics for jump arcs,
            momentum, and recovery windows. I iterated heavily on animation state handling and collision behavior so
            movement feels smooth and predictable. Beyond core movement, I focused on level pacing, fail-state clarity,
            and recovery timing so difficult sections feel learnable rather than random. Ongoing work is focused on
            adding levels, boss-style encounters, and stronger pacing between platforming, combat, and humor beats,
            while keeping the control feel consistent across all stage types.</p>
