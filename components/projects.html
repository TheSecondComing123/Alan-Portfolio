                    A 2D roguelike built with Pygame and OpenGL where each run escalates through
                    denser enemy waves, tighter resource windows, and sharper decision-making. I
                    designed the combat loop around responsive controls, readable telegraphs, and
                    clear hit feedback so difficulty feels demanding but fair. Under the hood, I
                    focused heavily on performance, keeping frame pacing stable during high-entity
                    fights through aggressive update filtering and optimized collision checks.

                    A 2D platformer in Godot and GDScript centered on tight movement, readable
                    challenge design, and satisfying level flow. I’ve been tuning jump physics,
                    momentum, and recovery timing so controls stay consistent across both precision
                    platforming and combat sections. The current focus is expanding stage variety
                    and boss encounters while preserving a fair difficulty curve and the game’s
                    light comedic tone.
